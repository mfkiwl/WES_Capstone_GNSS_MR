`carrieri_wipeoff.v` Depends on Xilinx CORDIC' https://docs.xilinx.com/v/u/en-US/pg105-cordic </br>
`comparator.v` Compares to values to if greater than or equal returns true if so. </br>
`mag_squared.v` Does a magnitude estimation by taking the sum of the absolute value of I and Q data </br>
`maximum_index.v` Book keeps the maximum index based on the highest peak detected. Data bookept eventually becomes codephase, frequency index, first and second peak. </br>
`second_peak_detector.v` This module helps zero out the exclude limit region near the highest peak for current frequency bin index. </br>
